            In the academic year 2017-2018, the college community was comprised
            of 2061 undergraduate students.

          We have traditionally looked at institutional diversity through charts
          like these, but what does diversity look like on the ground? How does
          this diversity in numbers manifest in campus life?

          Williams is a residential college, so a large proportion of social
          interactions are determined by where you live. <br /><br />
          Letâ€™s take a look at the college dorms.

      <div id="body-container" style="padding-bottom: 100vh;">

            First-year students entering Williams are assigned to live in one of
            three dorms.
            <br /><br />We can see the compositions of these houses compared to
            the college wide racial makeup.

          <div class="body-text trigger" data-step="5" style="padding-top:50vh">
            This comparison is quantified using a Chi-squared test and buildings
            are color-coded based on how similar they are to the college wide
            racial makeup.

            After their first year, students have the freedom to choose who they
            live with and where they live based on a lottery pick. <br /><br />
            Let's take a look at where the class of 2021 moved for their
