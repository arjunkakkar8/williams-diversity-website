          <span style="font-size: 30px;">Welcome to Williams,</span> a small
          liberal arts college located in the heart of the berkshires.

            In the academic year 2017-2018, the college community was comprised
            of 2061 undergraduate students.

          We have traditionally looked at institutional diversity through charts
          like these, but what does diversity look like on the ground? How does
          this diversity in numbers manifest in campus life?

        <div class="body-text trigger" data-step="3" style="padding-top:10vh;">
          Williams is a residential college, so a large proportion of social
          interactions are determined by where you live. <br /><br />
          Let’s investigate this question by taking a look at the college dorms.
        </div>
      </div>
      <div id="body-container" style="padding-bottom:100vh;">
        <div class="housing">
          <div class="body-text trigger" data-step="4" style="padding-top:50vh">
            First-year students entering Williams are assigned to live in one of
            three dorms.
            <br /><br />We can see the compositions of these houses compared to
            the college wide racial makeup to see how similar or dissimilar they
            are.
          </div>
          <div class="body-text trigger" data-step="5" style="padding-top:50vh">
            This comparison is quantified using a Chi-squared test and buildings
            are color-coded based on how likely the population breakdown is
            given that no factors with racial biases were involved in housing
            selection.
          </div>
          <div id="color-scale" style="padding-top:2vh;"></div>
          <div class="body-text">
            For any building, a value below 5%, indicated from here on in shades
            of red, can be interpreted as extremely unlikely to happen randomly
            — there is a significant deviation from the college-wide racial
            composition.
          </div>
          <div class="body-text trigger" data-step="6" style="padding-top:50vh">
            After their first year, students have the freedom to choose who they
            live with and where they live based on a lottery pick. <br /><br />
            Here's a look at where the class of 2021 moved for their sophomore
            year.
          </div>
          <div class="body-text" style="padding-top:10vh">
            The movement of sophomores predominantly towards the west side
            greylock quad of campus is a cultural norm at Williams. In fact,
            most buildings and regions on campus have associated norms and
            stereotypes of who lives in them.
            <br /><br />Therefore, overlaying this colloquial knowledge with the
            racial composition of a building can give a deeper insight into the
            degree of diverse interactions on campus. <br /><br />With this in
            mind, let's look at some specific buildings on campus.
          </div>
          <div class="body-text trigger" data-step="7" style="padding-top:50vh">
            <span style="font-size: 30px;">Poker Flats</span> is a coop senior
            dorm. Coop lotteries at Williams are smaller and conducted much
            earlier than the general housing lottery. Therefore, there is a
            larger degree of intentionality and selection involved in coop
            housing choice. <br /><br />In 2017, 4 of the 5 buildings with the
            largest proportion of white students on campus were coops. Poker
            Flats was one of the most dissimilar in composition to the rest of
            the college with a large proportion of white students deciding to
            live here.<br /><br />It is colored in deep orange to indicate that
            this composition would be very unlikely without the presence of
            racial factors in housing selection.
          </div>
          <div class="body-text trigger" data-step="8" style="padding-top:50vh">
            <span style="font-size: 30px;">Lehman Hall</span> is a dorm
            accessible through the general housing lottery. Although any student
            after their first year can pick into Lehman, it typically houses
            juniors and seniors.<br /><br />
            Of all the dorms on campus, Lehman has the largest proportion of
            asian and hispanic students. At the same time, it has the smallest
            proprtion of white students. <br /><br />
            Lehman is colored in deep red due to the extreme disparity in these
            proportions.

            <span style="font-size: 30px;">Horn Hall</span> is the newest
            building on campus and was opened in the fall of 2017. Horn is also
            available on the general housing lottery to all students after their
            first year. <br /><br />
            It has the largest proportion of black students on campus and the
            second smallest proportion of white students after Lehman. As a
            result, it is also colored deep red.
